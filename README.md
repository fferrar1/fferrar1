ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a 19-year-old from the countryside of SÃ£o Paulo with a passion for programming. I love diving into new coding challenges and am always looking for ways to evolve my skills.

Outside of tech, you can find me with a book in hand ðŸ“–, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchenðŸŽ‚, or exploring the latest fashion trends ðŸ‘— and historical stories that inspire me. I'm all about combining creativity with logic, and I believe there's always something new to learn.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
